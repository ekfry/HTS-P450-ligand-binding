# HTS-P450-ligand-binding
This script is used to analyze cytochrome P450-ligand binding data from a high throughput assay as described by Dr. Emily E. Scott and Elyse Frydendall (2024).

The following script was written to process spectral data obtained from a plate reader as referred to in "Development of a high throughput cytochrome P450-ligand binding assay." The script is equipped to analyze cytochrome P450 binding assay data from high throughput screens. The script corrects spectra for background absorbance, prints absolute and difference spectra for each assay, and estimated dissociation constants and âˆ†Amax values for each assay based on the one-site, specific binding and tight-binding or Morrison equation.
